# Spatial Partitioning
Put this project onto github for the purposes of archiving old projects. Made in 2019.

## Overview
Control a circle using WASD and collide with 5000 circles.

Made this project because I wanted to learn how to make a simple physics engine with circles colliding. The circles conserve momentum and displace the other circles. I also wanted to figure out how to optimize the code so that thousands of circles could collide without slowing down the computer too much and I did that through spatial partitioning.

## Usage
Run `index.html` in any web browser.

Use WASD keys for movement.
